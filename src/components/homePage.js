								<p>New technologies enable us to rethink and reengineer new ways to distribute <strong>charitable donations.</strong></p>
								<p>The traditional charitable system has undergone a slow evolution and is out of date and out of touch.</p>
								<p>It too often provides short-term, one-size-fits-all solutions that fail address the root causes of the problems they are trying to solve.</p>
								<p>The Giveth community is building a new system, using Ethereum smart contracts, that will radically shift the way people think charity can and should work. Instead of a large centralized organization taking money from donors and paying people to make a change, donors are able to directly connect to the change makers on the ground in a system where accountability and transparency are the default. </p>
								<p>With this decentralization reative solutions to global issues will emerge in a local fashion, and any methods that are successful for one group can spread virally within the particular cause. In fact, because of the open source nature of this system, successful solutions can scale across all causes. If a cat charity builds a successful governance structure, a homeless charity can easily use it for their own needs. This is <strong>Donation 3.0</strong>.</p>

								<h3>About Giveth</h3>
								<p>The core group is an eclectic mix from the Ethereum and non-profit worlds that are teaming up to make it easy to build anyone to build a global community around a cause. In fact, this core team wants to build a community around the Giveth idea itself! If you want to help create the solution, <a href="http://slack.giveth.io/" className="join">join our Slack</a>.</p>
								<p>At Giveth, <strong>we believe</strong>:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Donating can be simple, fun and effective.</li>
									<li><strong>Transparency</strong> and <strong>accountability</strong> can be the default.</li>
									<li>Everyone with ideas that can make a positive impact can be heard and funded.</li>
									<li>Every doner can have the ultimate say over how their donation is used.</li>
									<li>People that want to do good work for their cause can be rewarded for their actions.</li>
									<li><strong>Real change</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong> comes from the communities joining together fighting to make the world a better place.</li>

							<div className="col-xs-12 col-md-7">
								<p>Giveth is dedicated to a completely open source development process every step of the way, we want to enable awesome solutions for <strong>anyone</strong> to use and improve upon.</p>
								<p>The charitable system is slowly evolving and starting to integrate blockchain technology for its frictionless, global, transparent transactions. But Giveth is <strong>leap frogging</strong> this slow integration and taking it to the next level, enabling decentralized organizations to form, and participants to interact with eachother in a safe, trustless manner using smart contracts.</p>
								<p>Giveth's smart contracts automate accounting, international fund distribution, and many other services that are usually done by large charities with economics of scale.</p>
								<p>At the same time, these smart contracts also enable donors and change makers to work together to crowdsource powerful solutions and give these organizations the flexibility to develop their own unique governance and incentive structures to bring more impact for their given resources.</p>

							<h2>The Giveth Solution</h2>
							<div className="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
								<p>Giveth's smart contracts allow donors to take any level of interest they desire. They can tag their donation to be sent to a general catagory (e.g. Ethereum Projects) or directly to their favorite decentralized charitable organization. Either way they will be notified how every part of their donation was used. This will be extremely easy as all donations go directly to the change makers on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
								<p>Giveth's open source system makes transparency, accountability, communication and efficiency the default. Change makers and donors will be able to connect to eachother directly to exchange ideas and show progress, and when Ethereum's social networking DApps go live </p>
							</div>
							<div className="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
								<p>Change Makers will be encouraged to use our current Milstone Tracker Contract, where donations are only collected upon the completion of pre-arranged milestones. This creates a <strong>result-focused incentive structure</strong> naturally aligning everyones intentions.</p>
								<p>The Giveth core team has completed v0.1 of Giveth's <strong>[DApp (Donation Application)](TODO: ADD LINK TO UI)</strong> using our own system.  This means there is complete transparency on how the donations sent to the Giveth platform have been spent. #dogfooding</p>
								<p>Our current DApp is still in the early prototype stage and focuses on the distribution of funds to the change makers. We are currently developing v0.2 which will include ERC 20 tokens and a liquid democracy enabled donation tagging system.</p>
